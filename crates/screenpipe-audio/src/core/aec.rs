//! Software acoustic echo cancellation (AEC).
//!
//! macOS issue #3938: Apple's VoiceProcessingIO echo canceller removes 0 dB
//! because its output element is never fed a downlink reference. Rather than
//! couple two capture streams into a platform audio unit, we cancel in the
//! engine using the system-audio lane we already capture (`process_tap.rs`) as
//! the far-end reference. One canceller then replaces the no-op macOS VPIO and
//! the Windows-only WASAPI path, and works on any microphone.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! A constrained **partitioned-block frequency-domain adaptive filter**
//! (PBFDAF) — the standard frequency-domain LMS structure used by most echo
//! cancellers. The far-end (loudspeaker) signal is filtered by an adaptive FIR
//! that models the loudspeaker→room→mic echo path; the estimate is subtracted
//! from the near-end (mic) signal.
//!
//! - Block length `L` = 160 samples = 10 ms @ 16 kHz (the transcription rate).
//! - FFT length `M` = 2·L (overlap-save: discard the first L of each IFFT).
//! - `P` partitions ⇒ a `P·L`-tap filter, covering `P·10 ms` of combined
//!   bulk delay + room tail. Per-bin power normalization (NLMS) gives
//!   scale-independent, fast convergence.
//! - **Gradient constraint** per partition (IFFT → zero the tail half → FFT)
//!   keeps each partition a causal linear-convolution block, which is what
//!   makes the frequency-domain filter stable rather than circular-aliased.
//! - A **double-talk detector** freezes adaptation when the near-end talker is
//!   active, so the canceller never adapts to (and erases) local speech.
//!
//! The whole thing is real `f32` DSP with no platform or hardware dependency,
//! which is what lets `aec_tests` measure ERLE deterministically in CI.
