/**
 * Pins the ownership rule that keeps a background pipe's owned-browser
 * navigation out of an unrelated chat.
 *
 * The owned browser is a singleton webview shared by every chat and every
 * background pipe; its navigate event is broadcast to all windows. Pre-fix the
 * single `<BrowserSidebar>` revealed (and persisted) every navigation into
 * whatever chat was on screen. The fix tags each navigation with an owner and
 * the sidebar drops navigations owned by a different chat. This is the
 * deterministic counterpart to the integration test in
 * `e2e/specs/zz-owned-browser-background-nav.spec.ts`.
